# x Multiplication Facts x
You are going to create a program that tests the user with 10 random multiplication facts. You will give the user a problem, get their answer, and then give them the next problem. You will report how many they got correct out of 10 at the end of the program. If they got any of the problems wrong, you will give them a change to repeat those SAME problems to improve their score. After they have done those problems, report their new score.

The multiplication problems can be between two numbers from 1 to 15, inclusive.

In this program, you must incorporate AT LEAST one array. You might find that have a few arrays will be useful, but at a minimum, you need to use one that is an integral part of your program.

Here is a sample run of the program:
